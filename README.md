WeatherPy

This project is a weather visualization script that utilizes OpenWeatherMap APIs, Python requests, and JSON to gather weather data for over 500 cities located at different distances from the equator. The script aims to explore the relationship between the city's latitude and various weather variables. It accomplishes this by generating different plots and applying a linear regression model for each relationship to identify any potential patterns or correlations.


VacationPy

FFor this challenge, I utilize Jupyter notebooks, the geoViews Python library, and the Geoapify API to create map visualizations for weather data analysis, specifically for planning future vacations. The notebook creates a map that displays each city with a different color based on weather data. Additionally, the script leverages longitude and latitude data to find the nearest hotels for each city on the map. This interactive map helps users identify suitable vacation destinations based on weather conditions and nearby hotel options.
